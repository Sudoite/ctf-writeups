# Puzzlingly Accountable

This 100-point forensics problem is the lowest-point problem in Level 4 of PicoCTF2017. The problem contains a PCAP file that apparently is a capture of a spider being used to repeatedly retrieve content from a Web application. Opening the PCAP file in Wireshark indicates that most of the traffic volume is TCP traffic, and particularly HTML GET requests. Filtering by TCP traffic and scrolling through the results shows that a few pages are from a directory containing the word `secret` in it, and the images that have been downloaded are not linked to from the main `index.html` file. Quickly filtering using the keyword `tcp contains secret` yields four GET requests, and following the TCP stream for each request produces the data for four PNG files. Directly outputting the files using `File->Export` did not work for me, so I simply looked up the hexadecimal bytes associated with the magic header for a PNG file, directly copied each of the four sets of bytes into a text file, and wrote a small Python program to write each byte string out to a file. Opening each of the PNG files then revealed 1/4 of a hexadecimal code, and positioning the files together like a jigsaw puzzle then revealed the flag. Anyone working on this problem on their own should keep in mind that the number 1 looks like the number 7 in the image files.
