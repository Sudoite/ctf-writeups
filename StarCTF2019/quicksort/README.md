# quicksort

*CTF 2019


This is a pwnable based on the Quicksort algorithm.

### Reconnaissance

Problem description:


```
Iâ€™m very quick!

$ nc 34.92.96.238 10000
```

Here's a simple interaction with the server:

```
how many numbers do you want to sort?
17
the 1th number:4
the 2th number:8
the 3th number:2
the 4th number:3
the 5th number:1
the 6th number:0
the 7th number:-5
the 8th number:99999
the 9th number:1234
the 10th number:40
the 11th number:29
the 12th number:98
the 13th number:42
the 14th number:30
the 15th number:0
the 16th number:0
the 17th number:1
Here is the result:
-5 0 0 0 1 1 2 3 4 8 29 30 40 42 98 1234 99999
```

The pwnable is a 32-bit Linux binary. Checksec shows:

```
RELRO           STACK CANARY      NX            PIE             RPATH      RUNPATH      FILE
Partial RELRO   Canary found      NX enabled    No PIE          No RPATH   No RUNPATH   quicksort
```

There's an alarm called, so I start by disabling it so I can debug the binary.

A quick look at this with IDA and Ghidra shows a buffer overflow vulnerability:

```
void FUN_08048816(void)

{
  int *piVar1;
  int iVar2;
  int in_GS_OFFSET;
  char local_30;
  undefined local_2f;
  undefined local_2e;
  undefined local_2d;
  undefined local_2c;
  undefined local_2b;
  undefined local_2a;
  undefined local_29;
  undefined local_28;
  undefined local_27;
  undefined local_26;
  undefined local_25;
  undefined local_24;
  undefined local_23;
  undefined local_22;
  undefined local_21;
  int local_20;
  int local_1c;
  int local_18;
  void *local_14;
  int local_10;

  local_10 = *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14);
  local_2f = 0;
  local_2e = 0;
  local_2d = 0;
  local_2c = 0;
  local_2b = 0;
  local_2a = 0;
  local_29 = 0;
  local_28 = 0;
  local_27 = 0;
  local_26 = 0;
  local_25 = 0;
  local_24 = 0;
  local_23 = 0;
  local_22 = 0;
  local_21 = 0;
  local_30 = 0;
  local_20 = 0;
  puts("how many numbers do you want to sort?");
  __isoc99_scanf(&DAT_08048aa6,&local_20);
  getchar();
  local_14 = malloc(local_20 << 2);
  local_1c = 0;
  while (local_1c < local_20) {
    printf("the %dth number:",local_1c + 1);
    gets(&local_30);
    piVar1 = (int *)(local_1c * 4 + (int)local_14);
    iVar2 = atoi(&local_30);
    *piVar1 = iVar2;
    local_1c = local_1c + 1;
  }
  FUN_08048770((int)local_14,0,local_20 + -1);
  puts("Here is the result:");
  local_18 = 0;
  while (local_18 < local_20) {
    printf("%d ",*(undefined4 *)((int)local_14 + local_18 * 4));
    local_18 = local_18 + 1;
  }
  puts("");
  free(local_14);
  if (local_10 != *(int *)(in_GS_OFFSET + 0x14)) {
                    /* WARNING: Subroutine does not return */
    __stack_chk_fail();
  }
  return;
}
```

There's a buffer overflow vulnerability, but there's also a canary on the stack. I checked the quicksort algorithm and it's implemented correctly. Next I noticed that I think I can overwrite the pointer to the array of integers to be sorted, which means that perhaps I could do something like sort the entries in the Global Offset Table.

Well first of all I need to be able to return to main so that I can leak a libc address. The only place where I can do such a leak is right before the program returns, when the results of the sort routine are printed to `stdout`. My first thought is to just overwrite the GOT address of `free` with the address of `main`. That should work. To do that, I need to sort a single number. That number is just whatever I plan to write to the GOT plus some text that `atoi` will ignore and the overwrite of A*.

```
0xfffbe910:	0xfffbe92c	0x00000001	0xfffbe958	0x080488c5
0xfffbe920:	0xf7ecece0	0x00000000	0x00002000	0x00000000
0xfffbe930:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x00000001
0xfffbe940:	0x00000000	0x00000000	0x088ec160	0x81440f00
0xfffbe950:	0x00000001	0x00000000	0xfffbe968	0x080489e4
```
now goes to

```
0xfffbe910:	0xfffbe92c	0x00000001	0xfffbe958	0x080488c5
0xfffbe920:	0xf7ecece0	0x00000000	0x00002000	0x08048816
0xfffbe930:	0x41414141	0x41414141	0x41414141	0x00000001
0xfffbe940:	0x42424242	0x42424242	0x0804a018	0x81440f00
0xfffbe950:	0x00000001	0x00000000	0xfffbe968	0x080489e4
```

Great! The canary is intact and now I'm writing the address of main to the GOT address of free. And it works! I return to main.

Next, I figured out that I can leak a libc address by reading an array of size two from an array starting at the very end of the Global Offset Table (containing a reference to `atoi`). As part of this I have to do a single write as well, so I wrote any positive number as the second entry. Since the `libc` addresses are all negative integers (starting with `0xf7`), quicksort doesn't overwrite the `atoi` reference with my positive integer. That lets me calculate the offset to `system`.

I then want to make two writes. The first is to place `/bin/sh` in the `.bss` section. I then want to overwrite the reference to `free` (now `main`) in the GOT with a reference to `system`, and as part of the same set of writes, have the array `A` now point to the `.bss` section containing `/bin/sh`. That worked. One last problem is that I actually used `/bin//sh` as my string, but that caused quicksort to rearrange it into `//sh/bin`! Each integer's place after being sorted depends on the last character in the string, which is the highest-order byte for the integer due to little-endianness. So, I rearranged my argument to `system` to be `///bin/sh;tt`.

That gives me the flag!

### Comparison to other approaches

[Auxy233](https://github.com/Auxy233/writeups/blob/master/2019/2019-04-28-StarCTF.md#quicksort) leaks the canary, then performs the exploit using a ROP chain. [zer0pts](https://ptr-yudai.hatenablog.com/entry/2019/04/29/122753#Pwn-155-quicksort) quite cleverly bypasses the stack protection by overwriting `__stack_chk_fail` in the GOT with a `ret` gadget. [This write-up], from what I gather, overwrites the `free` pointer in the Global Offset Table with one to `printf`, then uses the fact that `free` is applied to a pointer to a buffer with content under the user's control to leak a `libc` address. Then the leaked `libc` address is used to compute the address of a One Gadget, jump to it, and leak `system`. There are quite a lot of ways to solve this particular challenge, really interesting!
