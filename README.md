# ctf-writeups

This is a repository of writeups for various CTF challenges. I am intentionally leaving in discussion about where I made mistakes or went down blind alleys, as such occasions can be great learning experiences, both for the person solving the challenge and potentially for the person reading the writeup. I hope they are informative and entertaining! To read a write-up, just click through to the `.md` file with the same name as the challenge.

Here are some of my favorites:

1. [Turtles](./CSAW2018/turtles) from CSAW 2018 -- an entertaining Objective-C exploit that makes use of heap exploitation, format string attacks, and a buffer overflow / ROP chain

2. [Leakless](./FireshellCTF2019/leakless) from Fireshell CTF 2019 -- a manual implementation of an attack that hijacks dynamic symbol resolution in Linux

3. [Choose](./PicoCTF2017/final): the final challenge for PicoCTF2017, in which I independently discovered an approach for bypassing a stack canary using characteristics of memory alignment for C structs in the GCC compiler

4. [ECC2](./PicoCTF2017/ECC2): an elliptic curve cryptography problem from PicoCTF 2017


## By category and technique

### Pwnable Challenges

#### Heap Exploitation

1. [Turtles](./CSAW2018/turtles): Squeezing as many fake smallbins as possible into a small space on the heap; writing a ROP chain that will work despite part of it getting copied from the stack to the heap, potentially corrupting the heap

2. [Chat Logger](./PicoCTF2017/chat-logger) (PicoCTF 2017): abuse a bug in the program to change the maximum length of a message, then edit a short message to overwrite a subsequent chunk in the heap

3. [Enter the Matrix](./PicoCTF2017/matrix) (PicoCTF 2017): Exploit a bug in how rows and columns of a matrix are accessed to write beyond a chunk's boundary

4. [Deeper into the Matrix](./PicoCTF2017/matrix-deeper) (PicoCTF 2017): get `calloc` to return a null pointer by allocating too much memory, and exploit the null pointer

5. [Heap Golf](./SwampCTF2019/heapgolf) (Swamp CTF 2019): simple heap problem illustrating how fastbins work


###### Use After Free

1. [Aggregator](./PicoCTF2017/aggregator) (PicoCTF 2017): Overwriting the Global Offset Table using Use After Free

2. [Choose](./PicoCTF2017/final) (PicoCTF 2017): 32-bit Linux `x86` shellcode to execute `execve`, split into 11-byte sections and using relative jumps to string the shellcode together

3. [pwn3](./TAMUCTF2019/pwn3) (TAMUCTF 2019): simple Linux `x86` shellcode, executed on the stack

3. [quicksort](./StarCTF2019/quicksort) (`*CTF2019`): A vulnerability in the C code allows function pointers to be overwritten -- but whatever then gets written is subsequently treated as a list of integers and sorted in place, leading to a creative specification of the `/bin/sh` string in order to execute `system("/bin/sh")`.

#### Bypassing full RELRO
