# ctf-writeups

This is a repository of writeups for various CTF challenges. I am intentionally leaving in discussion about where I made mistakes or went down blind alleys, as such occasions can be great learning experiences, both for the person solving the challenge and potentially for the person reading the writeup. I hope they are informative and entertaining!
