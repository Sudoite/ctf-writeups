# ctf-writeups

This is a repository of writeups for various CTF challenges. I am intentionally leaving in discussion about where I made mistakes or went down blind alleys, as such occasions can be great learning experiences, both for the person solving the challenge and potentially for the person reading the writeup. I hope they are informative and entertaining! To read a write-up, just click through to the `.md` file with the same name as the challenge.

Here are some of my favorites:

1. [Turtles](./CSAW2018/turtles/turtles.md) from CSAW 2018 -- an entertaining Objective-C exploit

2. [Leakless](./FireshellCTF2019/leakless/leakless.md) from Fireshell CTF 2019 -- a manual implementation of an attack that hijacks dynamic symbol resolution in Linux

3. [Choose](./PicoCTF2017/final/Final.md): the final challenge for PicoCTF2017, in which I independently discovered an approach for bypassing a stack canary using characteristics of memory alignment for C structs in the GCC compiler

4. [ECC2](./PicoCTF2017/ECC2/ECC2.md): an elliptic curve cryptography problem from PicoCTF 2017
